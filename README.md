### Description

The data folder contains the training, dev and test splits for the GePaDe-SpkAtt Corpus.
The data is in json format. Meta-information on the speakers, their party affiliation 
and the data of the speech are included in the dictionary keys for each sentence in the data.

The doc folder includes the paper, the annotation guidelines (in German) and the datasheet for our corpus.

The system_output folder includes the system output (or dev and test sets) for the BERT-large model
(see the description in the paper) for three independent runs with different initialisations (seeds: 8, 42, 313).

You can use the evaluation script (data/eval.py) to evaluate the system output against the gold data:

```
python eval.py <gold filename> <system output filename>
```

### Model

Our baseline model is the one of Conia & Navgili (2020):

```
Simone Conia and Roberto Navigli. 2020. Bridging the gap in multilingual semantic role labeling: a language-agnostic approach. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 1396â€“1410, Barcelona, Spain (Online). International Committee on Computational Linguistics.
```

To run the model, first download and install the SRL system. Follow the instructions provided on the authors' github page.

Then download our pretrained [model for speaker attribution in parliamentary debates](https://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/spkatt/model.tgz) 
and put it in the XX folder.










More detailed instructions on how to train/test the model will be added later.
